This repository is made for implementation of gradient descent and its variations, and Logistic and Linear Regression models from scratch. Currently the following algorithms have been implemented:

1. Batch Gradient Descent
2. Stochastic Gradient Descent
3. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

More algorithms will be added further on.
Requirements: Python 3+ and Numpy.
