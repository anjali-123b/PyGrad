This repository is made for implementation of gradient descent and its variations, and Logistic and Linear Regression models from scratch. Currently the following algorithms have been implemented:
1. Linear Regression (uses Batch Gradient Descent)
2. Logistic Regression (uses Batch Gradient Descent)
3. Stochastic Gradient Descent
4. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
